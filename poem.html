        <p>MIghty miracles created from wraith,
           All it takes is just a little faith,
           I have the same and so very much more
           What then, May I, One fine day, have in store? 
           I know not with surly,but this much
           Amougst my most passionate desires
           There is an Angel, with which I wish consort
           I pray same thusly, tohim I'd exhort
           I have asked naught of Thee, yet I ask how
           Or why you'd send this Angel to me, 
           Only that you help this Angel to see
           The truth in her own heart,andthat in mine
           Bring the faith and make it shine </p>
      
        <p>Welcome to my torture room,
           my painful den of sorrows.
           Although today you are alive,
           I can promise no tommorrow.
           It's here I learned to terroize,
           in ways most men don't think.
           It's here where victims salt from tears,
           spice my bloody drink.
           Where hearts and eyes lie side by side,
           beside my side by side.
           I still get chill's both now and then,
           when they cry and ask me why.
           This one room below my den,
           were walls or draped with drying skin
           In which there's only one way out,
           once that you are in.
           Welcome to my torture room,
           you're never gonna leave it.
           At least not while your still alive,
           Its unbelieveable.
           Believe it. </p>
